	If this is your first time using Arduino, please read through our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide). If you have not installed an Arduino library before, we recommend you check out our [installation guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library).

We've written a couple examples to demonstrate the basics and configuration options for the Indoor Air Quality Sensor SCD41 SEN55 built using a couple of Sensirion's Arduino libraries for these sensors along with SparkFun's SCD4x library. Users can install these libraries through the Arduino Library Manager tool by searching for <b>"Sensirion Core"</b>, <b>"Sensirion I2C SEN5x"</b>, and <b>"SparkFun SCD4x</b> then install the latest version.

Those who prefer to manually install the libraries can download ZIPs of the libraries by clicking the buttons below:

[SparkFun SCD4x Arduino Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_SCD4x_Arduino_Library/archive/refs/heads/main.zip){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

<center>
[Sensirion Arduino Core Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-core/archive/refs/heads/main.zip){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

[Sensirion I2C SEN5x Arduino Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-i2c-sen5x/archive/refs/heads/master.zip){ .md-button .md-button--primary}

With the libraries installed let's move on to looking at a few of the examples included in it.
