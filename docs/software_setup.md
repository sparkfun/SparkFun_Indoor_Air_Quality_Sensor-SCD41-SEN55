	If this is your first time using Arduino, please read through our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide). If you have not installed an Arduino library before, we recommend you check out our [installation guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library).

We've written a couple examples to demonstrate the basics and configuration options for the Indoor Air Quality Sensor SCD41 SEN55 built using a couple of Sensirion's Arduino libraries for these sensors. Users can install these libraries through the Arduino Library Manager tool by searching for <b>"Sensirion Core"</b> and <b>"Sensirion I2C SEN5x"</b> and installing the latest version.

Those who prefer to manually install the libraries can download ZIPs of the libraries by clicking the buttons below:

<center>
[Sensirion Core Arduino Library (ZIP)](){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
</center>

<center>
[Sensirion I2C SEN5x Arduino Library (ZIP)](){ .md-button .md-button--primary}
</center>

With the library installed let's move on to looking at a few of the examples included in it.
